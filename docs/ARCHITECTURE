# Cubase 15 System Architecture Overview

A technical breakdown of Cubase 15's internal structure as observed through official scripting interfaces and public documentation.

## Audio Engine Pipeline


- **Multi-core rendering**: Each track processes on separate threads when possible  
- **Latency compensation**: Automatic delay alignment for parallel processing chains  
- **Sample rate conversion**: 32-bit float internal processing regardless of project rate  

## MIDI Processing Flow

1. Hardware input → MIDI Remote surface mapping  
2. Event filtering (through Input Transformer)  
3. Routing to target track or VST instrument  
4. Real-time visualization in Key Editor  
5. Recording to project timeline  

## Project File Structure (.cpr)

Cubase project files are **binary containers** with the following logical sections:
- **Media Pool**: References to all audio/MIDI clips  
- **Track List**: Hierarchical arrangement of channels  
- **Automation Lanes**: Per-parameter envelope data  
- **Plugin States**: Serialized VST configurations  
- **Metadata**: Tempo map, markers, comments  

## MediaBay Database

- Stores indexed metadata for all media files  
- Uses SQLite backend (`mediabay.db`)  
- Supports custom tagging and rating systems  
- Searchable via `MediaBay.find()` API (limited exposure)  

## Security Boundaries

Cubase enforces strict sandboxing:
- Scripts cannot access file system outside project directory  
- No network communication permitted from Lua context  
- VST plugins run in isolated processes (on Windows)  

> This analysis is derived solely from observable behavior and Steinberg's public documentation. No reverse engineering was performed.
